<h1>ARTIST STATEMENT</h1>

<p> 
 Art has always been a passion for me since I was very young. When I was about five years I have learned that art is my hobby. I found this out one time when I was bored one day and took a pencil and piece of paper. At first I wasn’t sure what I was doing and just started scribbling. But then I have got inspired to draw something that had related to what I had done a few week back. The first time I drew an airplane I was very proud of how it turned out because it was through only my memory and that I had no reference pictures to look at.<br>
I began pursuing my passion in art by always drawing on plain white piece of paper. Then I moved on to experimenting with painting, where I used watercolors, acrylics and oil paints to paint on canvases. When I was in high school I have learned that I love to design too because I had taken an elective class where I have learned to be inspired by it. This had made realize that I would love to work with other graphic designers and become a graphic designer myself.<br>
In the future, I would like to teach children about the skills in art I have learned while I was growing up. Here I’m now, majoring in graphic design at San Jose State University. While I’m still attending classes at San Jose State University, I took an digital media class and I have realized that there are many programs I didn’t know about that could help me in future design. <br>
When I used to go India for vacations, I began to take some classes at some art galleries, where I saw myself become more proficient in art. Then I found myself to be in an intermediate stage with my drawing and painting skills. The art classes I took in India, inspired me to take more classes over here too. This made me realize that I could make my hobby into a profession.</p>
