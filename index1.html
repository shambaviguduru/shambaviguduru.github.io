	<h2><center>ABOUT ME</center></h2>
 <div class="a">
 	<p>Hi! My name is Shambavi Guduru. I live in Fremont, California. I’m originally from India and I have been living in the United States since I was three years old. Art has always been a passion for me since I was young. I began pursuing my passion in art by always drawing on plain white paper. Then I moved on to experimenting with painting, where I used watercolors, acrylics and oil paints to paint on canvases. In the future, I would like to teach children about the skills in art I have learned while I was growing up. Here I’m now, majoring in graphic design at San Jose State University.</p>

 <h3><center>ABOUT THE ART</center></h3>
 <div class="b">
 	<p>When I used to go India for vacations, I began to take some classes at some art gallaries, where I saw myself become more proficient in art. Then I found myself to be in an intermediate stage with my drawing and painting skills. The art classes I took in India, inspired me to take more classes over here too. This made me realize that I could make my hobby into a profession.</p>
